# Current state (last updated: 2026-07-14)

Update this file after every completed ship (see `HANDOFF-UPDATE.md`).

## Core product

- Auth, signup, onboarding, roles (promoter / dj / both)
- Discover, profiles, DM conversations
- Booking requests via DM (pending / accepted / declined / cancelled)
- Rate proposals: open offers, fixed offers, DJ counter-proposals, accept/decline RPCs
- Events: create, edit, cancel, delete, lineup, send bookings, run sheet
- Event Plans (`/booking-plans`), Calendar (`/calendar`), Gigs (`/bookings`)
- Notifications, settings, account deletion
- DJ availability calendar

## Events

- Optional event flyer upload (JPEG/PNG/WebP, 5 MB, bucket `event-covers`)
- Portrait-friendly flyer display (not forced 16:9 crop)
- Event colour: 8 selectable + Auto (slate neutral when Auto or legacy slate)
- Flat solid artwork tiles (no glow)
- Event list: Active + History tabs; whole card links to detail
- **History hide:** bulk remove from History view (does not delete records)
- **Create/edit validation:** inline field errors after Save; start + finish time both required; notes length/line limits disable save
- **Notes** section on event detail (heading "Notes", muted section label)
- Edit with confirmation when booking-impacting fields change + group chat update message
- Run sheet: single planner view for assigned DJs; table on `lg+`, cards below
- Run sheet rows auto-created when DJ accepts
- Accepted bookings cancellable by planner or DJ with reason + group chat update
- Booking cards in DMs show **live** event fields from `events` when `event_id` set

## Calendar

- Mobile: date strip + selected-day agenda
- Desktop: month grid + day modal (wider layout, same behaviour)
- No intro/description copy under the page title (planner event calendar)
- **Status dot priority per date:** Accepted (green) → Pending (amber) → Upcoming (dark blue); Today uses tile outline, not dot colour
- **Cancelled events hidden** from calendar items, dots, and counts (History unchanged)
- Agenda/grid ordering: booking priority then start time (`sortPlannerCalendarAgendaItems`)
- Event cards: `Event Name · Venue Name` on one truncated line; coloured event accent bar
- **Shared mobile chrome:** `CalendarMobileChrome` owns month nav, legend row, and day-strip spacing for Events and Gigs calendars (standalone + dual-mode); day-strip chips use content-height `PlannerCalendarMobileDateStrip` markup (no fixed live chip height; `h-[3.75rem]` skeleton-only)
- **Gigs `Select dates` row:** secondary action reserves space from first frame — disabled real button while calendar data loads; dual-mode parent falls back to same button before child chrome registers (no legend/strip shift)
- **Gigs legend-to-strip gap (mobile):** day scroller uses `mt-1` (`CALENDAR_MOBILE_CHROME_GIGS_DAY_STRIP_CLASS`) vs Events `mt-4`; desktop unchanged (`md:hidden` on strip wrapper)
- **Calendar mobile polish (2026-07-14):** shared `calendarMobileUi` — selected-day header, dashed empty state with muted calendar icon, agenda fade/slide transition (175ms, `motion-reduce`), `active:scale-[0.98]` press on day chips/cards/arrows; month title `text-base`; nav arrow gap `gap-0`; compact mobile agenda cards
- **Gigs booked-card navigation (2026-07-14):** mobile agenda cards navigate on touch `pointerup` via `window.location.assign` (iOS Safari does not commit App Router `router.push`); desktop mouse and keyboard use `router.push`; booked items validate UUID `event_id` before navigation; calendar return query params preserved on event/DM links; calendar-origin DMs return to Gigs Calendar via `buildCalendarOriginReturnHref` (not Messages)
- Create-from-calendar: Save event + **Confirm N DJ(s)** invite flow
- Today highlight on date strip; selected + today states on desktop grid cells

## DJ availability calendar

- Mobile (`< md`): horizontal date strip + selected-day panel — status buttons (Available / Maybe / Unavailable / Clear), booking list, today/selected chip styling aligned with planner event calendar strip
- Desktop (`md+`): month grid with per-date overflow menu unchanged
- Bulk select + quick select (Fridays / Saturdays / weekends) on all breakpoints; mobile strip toggles selection in bulk mode
- **Legend + strip dots:** compact dot-and-label legend (shared `CalendarDotLegend`) — Available light blue, Maybe amber, Unavailable red, Pending Request amber (same `FTC_STATUS_PENDING_DOT` / badge warning token), Booked green; date-strip dots use the same mapping with `+N` for multiple markers
- **Past dates:** availability controls hidden (mobile panel + desktop cell menu); empty booking message and mobile helper text suppressed; historical availability badges and booking cards remain visible
- Shared strip component: `PlannerCalendarMobileDateStrip` accepts optional `getDateMarker` for DJ markers (`getDjAvailabilityDateStripMarker`)

## Booking / invite UX

- Default send button label mode: **Confirm N DJ(s)** (`SendBookingRequestsPanel`)
- Unavailable-DJ confirm modal uses Confirm wording
- Calendar-origin and standard create flows aligned on copy and validation

## Event Plans

- **Mobile cards (2026-07-14):** compact layout below `sm` — title + vertically centred Use plan on one row; inline `Event` / `Venue` labels with `text-ftc-text-secondary` values and `text-ftc-text-muted` separator on one truncated line; NOTES label only when notes exist; tighter card padding and list spacing; desktop grid unchanged

## Group chat

- Per-event crew chat for owner + accepted DJs
- Messages inbox Group tab with artwork tile, deduped by event_id
- Event edit posts one update message to group chat (booking-impacting fields)
- Planner does not get unread from own group messages
- Group chat page: header only (duplicate context card removed)

## Copy / UX polish (2026-07)

- "Create event" sentence case (not "Create Event")
- No trailing periods on several confirmation dialogs and empty states
- Desktop planner UX brought into parity with mobile (wording, validation, calendar cards, today/selected styling) without copying mobile layout

## Desktop workspace & performance (2026-07-12)

- **Shared planner shell:** `PlannerWorkspacePage` in `app/components/planner/PlannerWorkspaceLayout.tsx` — Events, Event Plans, Calendar, Gigs share title row (heading derived from active workspace href via `resolvePlannerWorkspaceTitle`), primary tabs, divider, secondary controls baseline on desktop (`md:max-w-5xl`)
- **Desktop consistency tokens:** shared primary surface (`PLANNER_WORKSPACE_PRIMARY_SURFACE_CLASS`), list spacing (`PLANNER_WORKSPACE_LIST_CLASS`), title-row baseline alignment; Calendar reference shell — no duplicate in-card titles on desktop; loading skeletons match loaded layout
- **Calendar day selection:** desktop grid highlight tied to open day panel (`actionDate`); closing the panel clears the outline instantly (no transition fade) and blurs focus; Today styling unchanged
- **Page load speed:** optimistic auth in `OnboardingGuard` (cached session renders immediately); profile + nav role persisted to localStorage (userId-scoped) and seeded at module load; profile fetch starts immediately when session exists; auth guard runs profile fetch in parallel with session check; events list + group inbox caches survive hard refresh via localStorage; profile cache + deduped fetches in `lib/user/currentUser.ts`; nav skips redundant profile load when guard profile exists
- Desktop nav width aligned to page shell (`md:max-w-5xl`); `scrollbar-gutter: stable` on `<html>`
- **Navigation badges:** shared `NavBadgeProvider` with session/memory/localStorage cache — Gigs uses `ftc-gigs-pending-count` + runtime store; Messages uses matching `ftc-messages-unread-count` + runtime store (same sync-first pattern as Gigs sub-nav); both seeded at module load; main nav Messages badge reads cache via `getCachedNavMessagesCount` + `useSyncExternalStore`
- **Messages & Profile desktop:** Messages inbox uses `APP_DM_CONTENT_WIDTH_CLASS`; **Profile** uses matching `AppProfilePageShell` with single-column mobile flow (identity → social → cards), centred at `lg:max-w-[52rem]`
- **DM conversation desktop:** chat column `52rem` (~832px) at `lg+`, centered; mobile/tablet unchanged at `max-w-2xl`
